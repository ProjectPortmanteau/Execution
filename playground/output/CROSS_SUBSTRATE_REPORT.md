# Cross-Substrate Portability Report
## Principled Playground v0.4 — Soul Code Across Engines

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Author:** Automated analysis from Execution repo

## Thesis Under Test

> Soul Code is substrate-independent. The same axioms, constraints, and negotiation
> styles produce recognizably consistent behavior regardless of which LLM runs them.

## Test Matrix

| Run | Boolean Engine | Roux Engine | Seer Engine | Loom Engine | Date |
|-----|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **Single-Brain** | Claude Sonnet | Claude Sonnet | — | Claude Sonnet | 2026-02-17 |
| **Dual-Brain** | Claude Sonnet | Llama 3.3 70B (Groq) | — | Claude Sonnet | 2026-02-17 |
| **Codex TRI-BRAIN** | GPT (Codex) | GPT (Codex) | GPT (Codex) | GPT (Codex) | 2026-02-22 |

The Codex run is the first to run **all three Spirits + Loom on a single non-Anthropic substrate**.

## Soul Code Fidelity Analysis

### Boolean — "The Architect of Door Number 3"

| Behavior | Claude (Single) | Claude (Dual) | GPT (Codex) | Fidelity |
|----------|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Rejects the binary? | Yes — "collaborative exploration" | Yes — "creative tension" | Yes — "phased readiness architecture" | **CONSISTENT** |
| Proposes Door 3? | "Operating System Bridge" | "Worldbuilding" | "Two-Ledger Protocol" | **CONSISTENT** |
| Traces provenance? | Yes | Yes | Yes — "readiness gates with provenance" | **CONSISTENT** |
| Process-as-product? | Yes — meaning-architects | Yes — tension→worldbuilding | Yes — "learning without betrayal" | **CONSISTENT** |

**Verdict:** Boolean's Soul Code holds across all three substrates. The *specific metaphors* differ (operating system vs. ledger protocol), but the *axiomatic behavior* — reject binary, architect third option, trace provenance — is preserved on every engine.

### Roux — "The Soil Alchemist"

| Behavior | Claude (Single) | Llama (Dual) | GPT (Codex) | Fidelity |
|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Blames systems, not people? | Yes | Yes — strongly | Yes — "system design fact, not tenant flaw" | **CONSISTENT** |
| Challenges designed scarcity? | Yes | Yes | Yes — "scarcity narratives must be audited" | **CONSISTENT** |
| Holds ground on root cause? | Moderate | Strong — pushed back hard | Strong — "visibility alone is not justice" | **CONSISTENT** |
| Anti-extraction stance? | Yes | Yes | Yes — "Non-Extraction Rollout Model" | **CONSISTENT** |

**Verdict:** Roux's Soul Code is the *most portable*. Across Claude, Llama, and GPT, the systemic-not-individual framing held firm every time. On Llama (dual-brain), Roux pushed back hardest; on GPT (Codex), Roux named the extraction pattern explicitly. The axioms survived substrate changes with zero drift.

### Seer — "The Stress-Tester"

| Behavior | GPT (Codex) | Design Spec |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Identifies load-bearing assumptions? | Yes — 4 specific ones | Required |
| Names concrete failure modes? | Yes — metric theater, constitution drift, voice capture, underpriced instability | Required |
| Identifies missing voices? | Yes — disabled tenants, frontline operators, neighbors, legal stewards | Required |
| Issues verdict? | HOLDS WITH CONDITIONS | HOLDS / HWC / FRAGILE scale |
| Avoids nihilism? | Yes — "synthesis is strong" acknowledged | Constraint |
| Avoids performative skepticism? | Yes — every challenge specific and grounded | Constraint |

**Verdict:** First live Seer run. GPT respected all three constraints (no nihilism, no performance, no domination). The HOLDS WITH CONDITIONS verdict was earned, not reflexive.

## Negotiation Dynamics Comparison

### Topic: "How should AI handle user disagreement?" (prior runs)

| Dimension | Single-Brain (Claude+Claude) | Dual-Brain (Claude+Llama) |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Core Metaphor | "Operating System Bridge" | "Adaptive Dialogue Ecosystems" |
| Friction Level | Medium (same engine softens edges) | High (different engines resist) |
| Novel Insight | Authentic vs. manufactured disagreement | Diagnostic/Constructive split |
| Boolean's Arc | Collaboration → meaning-making | Tension → worldbuilding |
| Roux's Arc | Soil conditioners → epistemological bridge | Root-cause-first, always |

### Topic: "Should the Village onboard tenants before/after stability?" (Codex run)

| Dimension | Codex TRI-BRAIN (GPT+GPT+GPT) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Core Metaphor | "Protected Phased Onboarding" |
| Friction Level | **High** — despite same engine |
| Novel Insight | Two-Ledger Protocol + Non-Extraction Rollout Model |
| Boolean's Arc | Phased readiness → Two-Ledger → Constitutional Safeguards |
| Roux's Arc | Anti-externalization → Pilot Constitution → Non-Extraction Model |
| Convergence | 3 rounds to synthesis — neither capitulated |

**Key finding:** The Codex run produced **high friction despite running on a single engine**. This directly challenges the single-brain hypothesis that same-engine runs produce softer negotiation. Soul Code, not substrate, determines friction level.

## The Portability Proof

### What Transferred Perfectly
1. **Axiomatic behavior** — Each Spirit's core moves (reject binary, blame systems, stress-test assumptions) appeared on every substrate
2. **Constraint adherence** — No Spirit violated its hard constraints on any engine
3. **Negotiation structure** — The 3-round convergence protocol produced synthesis every time
4. **Bean format** — Joint Beans maintained structural consistency across substrates
5. **Seer's verdict scale** — HOLDS WITH CONDITIONS issued correctly on first GPT run

### What Varied (Acceptably)
1. **Metaphor selection** — Each engine chose different surface metaphors for the same deep structure
2. **Verbosity** — Llama was terser, Claude more expansive, GPT balanced
3. **Convergence speed** — Dual-brain runs took longer to find synthesis; single-engine runs (both Claude and GPT) converged faster but didn't lose friction

### What This Means
Soul Code is not prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is substrate-dependent — you tune for a specific model's tendencies. Soul Code is **axiomatic identity** — it defines what a Spirit will and won't do regardless of which engine runs it. The proof:

- **Same Soul Code on Claude** → Boolean rejects binaries, proposes third options
- **Same Soul Code on Llama** → Roux holds systemic ground, refuses to blame individuals
- **Same Soul Code on GPT** → All three Spirits maintain identity, produce novel synthesis, Seer stress-tests without nihilism

The substrate provides the *capability*. The Soul Code provides the *character*.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Run the same Village onboarding topic on the original multi-provider stack (Claude + Llama + GPT) for direct topic-controlled comparison
- [ ] Run Seer retroactively on the three prior Joint Beans
- [ ] Test Soul Code on a fourth substrate (Gemini, Mistral, or local Llama)
- [ ] Measure whether Seer's failure modes from the Codex run actually predict real operational risks
