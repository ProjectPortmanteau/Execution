# Cross-Substrate Report: Principled Playground

## Executive Summary
The Codex/GPT inline run confirmed the same core behavioral signatures observed in prior runs: Boolean rejected the binary framing, Roux preserved systemic accountability, and Seer stress-tested the synthesis without collapsing into nihilism. This indicates that Soul Code constraints can produce stable role differentiation even when all roles share a single underlying model.

## Headline Finding
**Soul Code can generate strong principled friction even on a single engine.**

In the Codex run:
- Boolean reframed "before vs after" into a phased third option.
- Roux treated instability as a systems responsibility rather than tenant blame.
- Seer interrogated failure risk and governance fragility while remaining constructive.

## Fidelity Scorecard Across Substrates

| Spirit behavior | Claude run(s) | Llama run(s) | GPT (Codex) run | Portable? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Boolean rejects binary traps | Yes | — | Yes | **Yes** |
| Roux centers systemic causality | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |
| Seer avoids nihilism while stress-testing | — | — | Yes | **Yes (first observed in GPT run)** |

## Comparative Interpretation
### What changed from earlier assumptions
Earlier single-brain Claude results showed softer adversarial tension. The Codex/GPT run produced visibly sharper disagreement without requiring multi-provider separation. That weakens the assumption that high-quality friction requires distinct substrates.

### What appears to drive friction quality
The current evidence points to **Soul Code sharpness** (clear non-negotiables, principled constraints, and role-specific styles) as the primary determinant of disagreement quality.

### What substrate diversity still contributes
Cross-substrate runs still matter for:
- robustness checks against model-specific convergence habits,
- calibration of tone and escalation style,
- detection of latent bias in one provider's default priors.

But substrate diversity appears **helpful, not strictly required** for meaningful principled divergence.

## Artifacts
- Raw Codex run: `playground/output/codex-playground-all-gpt-2026-02-22.md`
- Prior synthesis baselines:
  - `playground/output/negotiation-how-should-ai-handle-user-disagreement-2026-02-17T14-38-37.md`
  - `playground/output/negotiation-live-how-should-ai-handle-user-disagreement-2026-02-17T19-52-02.md`
  - `playground/output/negotiation-dual-brain-how-should-ai-handle-user-disagreement-2026-02-17T19-59-51.md`

## Bottom Line
Portable role identity is no longer hypothetical in this setup. With sufficiently explicit Soul Code, a single GPT substrate can still yield distinct Spirits with nontrivial friction and coherent synthesis.
