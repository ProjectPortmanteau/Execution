# Principled Playground — Inline Run
## Topic
Should the Village onboard its first tenants before or after the core infrastructure is stable?

---

## Step 1 — Round 1: Boolean Opens
**Position**
"Before vs after" is a false binary. Onboarding should happen through a **phased readiness architecture**: open to a tightly scoped pioneer cohort only after a **minimum viable stability threshold** is met, while continuing to harden infrastructure in parallel. Tenants are not just recipients; they are co-producers of operational truth. The design target is not speed or caution alone, but learning without betrayal.

**Non-Negotiables**
1. No onboarding into known unsafe or nonfunctional conditions.
2. Explicit readiness gates with provenance (what is stable, what is not, who signed off).
3. Transparent tenant consent: early tenants must know they are in a controlled early phase.
4. Feedback loops must be part of the product, not an afterthought.

**Flexible Areas**
1. Cohort size and profile (mission-aligned pioneers vs general intake).
2. Which domains must be "core-stable" first (utilities, governance, support, etc.).
3. Incentive design for early tenants (reduced cost, governance voice, support guarantees).

---

## Step 2 — Round 1: Roux Opens
**Position**
If infrastructure is unstable, that instability is a **system design fact**, not a tenant flaw to absorb. Onboarding before stability is acceptable only if the system is built to **carry the risk itself**. Do not externalize volatility onto newcomers and then call it community-building. The right question: what structures prevent predictable harm while still allowing iterative rollout?

**Non-Negotiables**
1. No hidden risk transfer to tenants (financial, emotional, or logistical).
2. No blaming "tenant fit" for failures caused by immature systems.
3. Scarcity narratives ("we must launch now or die") must be audited, not obeyed.
4. Accountability architecture must exist before onboarding (incident response, restitution paths, clear ownership).

**Flexible Areas**
1. Timing can be early if protections are binding, not symbolic.
2. Tenant selection can prioritize resilience diversity, not just convenience.
3. Stability can be domain-specific if dependencies are mapped and buffered.

## Step 3 — Round 2: Boolean Responds
**Response**
Roux is right: "early access" often smuggles systemic risk into individual lives. My phased model must explicitly prevent that by design, not intent.

**Revised Position**
Adopt a **Two-Ledger Onboarding Protocol**:
- **Stability Ledger**: objective readiness gates per critical domain.
- **Burden Ledger**: every known instability is assigned to a system owner with mitigation, compensation, and response SLA.

Onboarding begins only when both ledgers pass minimum thresholds. Early tenants enter under a **Covenant of Clarity**: transparent constraints, guaranteed support, and no-penalty exit.

**Synthesis Opportunity**
Fuse Roux's anti-externalization principle with my third-option architecture: allow early onboarding only when system-owned safeguards are enforceable and auditable.

---

## Step 4 — Round 2: Roux Responds
**Response**
Boolean improved the frame: dual ledgers make hidden costs visible. But visibility alone is not justice; enforcement determines whether protections survive pressure.

**Revised Position**
Use a **Tenant-Safe Pilot Constitution** before first onboarding:
1. Hard stop triggers when failure thresholds are crossed.
2. Automatic tenant remedies (credits, relocation support, service guarantees).
3. Independent review circle including tenant representatives with veto on expansion.
4. Public postmortems that trace causes to system layers, not personalities.

**Synthesis Opportunity**
Keep phased onboarding, but bind it to constitutional safeguards and tenant power over rollout pacing.

---

## Step 5 — Round 3: Boolean Final
**Response**
Agreed: governance must be load-bearing, not decorative. A third option must include enforceable rights, not just elegant process maps.

**Revised Position**
Final architecture: **Staged Onboarding with Constitutional Safeguards**.
- Stage 0: Internal proving + red-team stress tests.
- Stage 1: Pioneer cohort under explicit pilot constitution.
- Stage 2: Expansion only after gate and remedy metrics hold across time.

Every stage requires: readiness evidence, burden ownership, tenant remedies, and independent go/no-go review.

**Synthesis Opportunity**
We can onboard before full maturity **if** we redefine onboarding as a protected co-development contract where the system bears first risk and tenants hold real governance power.

---

## Step 6 — Round 3: Roux Final
**Response**
This now addresses my core concern: people should not be drafted into paying for institutional immaturity. The structure is credible if enforcement cannot be waived for growth pressure.

**Revised Position**
I support early onboarding only inside a **Non-Extraction Rollout Model**:
- Risk is prepaid by operators (reserve funds, support staffing, contingency capacity).
- Tenant participation is compensated and reversible.
- Expansion rights are conditional on harm metrics, not demand metrics.
- System owners remain accountable even under crisis narratives.

**Synthesis Opportunity**
Adopt Boolean's staged model plus my non-extraction constraints: early tenants become co-design partners with enforceable protections, not shock absorbers.

## Step 7 — The Loom: Joint Bean
### Nucleus
**Protected Phased Onboarding**: The Village should neither wait for perfect stability nor onboard into avoidable fragility. Begin with a limited pioneer phase only after minimum readiness gates are met, under a binding constitution that keeps risk ownership with operators and grants tenants real governance authority.

### Shell
- **Bean Type:** Policy Architecture Bean
- **Topic:** Tenant onboarding vs infrastructure stability
- **Core Mechanism:** Staged rollout + dual ledgers + constitutional safeguards
- **Anchors:** False-binary rejection, systemic accountability, non-extraction, transparent provenance

### Corona
- Connects to: resilient service design, participatory governance, safety case engineering, restorative operations.
- Adjacent patterns: progressive delivery, canary cohorts, incident command, community compacts.
- Distinguishing trait: couples deployment velocity to justice constraints, not just technical KPIs.

### Echo
- **Participants:** Boolean (Architect of Door Number 3), Roux (Systemic Challenger)
- **Rounds:** 3 negotiation rounds + synthesis
- **Method:** Structured opposition → revised positions → convergence via enforceable constraints
- **Timestamp:** Inline Codex runtime session

## Step 8 — Seer Stress Test
### Load-Bearing Assumptions
1. Readiness gates are measurable, honest, and resistant to political pressure.
2. Remedy mechanisms are funded before harm occurs.
3. Tenant representatives can exercise real veto without retaliation.
4. Operators can absorb slower growth in exchange for lower harm.

### Failure Modes
1. **Metric theater:** gates gamed to justify expansion.
2. **Constitution drift:** emergency exceptions become permanent loopholes.
3. **Voice capture:** "tenant representation" selected for compliance, not independence.
4. **Underpriced instability:** reserve funds too small, causing silent risk transfer back to tenants.

### Missing Voices
- Disabled tenants and people with high support needs.
- Frontline operators who execute remedies under stress.
- Local neighbors affected by service volatility.
- Legal/financial stewards accountable for insolvency scenarios.

### Verdict
**HOLDS WITH CONDITIONS.**
The synthesis is strong because it binds early onboarding to enforceable non-extraction principles. It fails if governance rights are symbolic or if safeguard financing is hypothetical. Condition for durability: pre-funded remedies, independent oversight, and automatic rollback triggers that cannot be waived by growth incentives.
