## [BEAN #PHIL-001] Title: Constitutional Amendment #1 - People > Money
- Principle: The inversion of value flow. Money is a resource (energy), not the objective.
- Content: "It’s not the money you love. It’s the freedom it can give that you really want." "If my why is to make money, then I’m lost... Money will come... in greater quantities" if the mission is authentic. [Source 1484, 1786]
- Application: Contracts must audit for empowerment. If a contract extracts value without empowering the human, it violates this amendment. [Source 1517]

## [BEAN #PHIL-002] Title: Constitutional Amendment #2 - The Soil Composition Matters
- Principle: Systemic Healing over Individual Blame.
- Content: "It’s not the person that is broken. Only broken systems." We do not fix people; we fix the environment (the soil) to allow their natural potential to grow. [Source 1634, 1693]
- Application: PFE focuses on creating an "Enabling Environment" rather than correcting "defective" employees.

## [BEAN #PHIL-003] Title: Constitutional Amendment #3 - No Boxes
- Principle: Anti-Categorization / Rejection of "Pathological Box Syndrome."
- Content: "You don’t have to be just one thing." "If you don’t use nuance, might as well live in a colorless world." "I’m not in this box, I’m in that one. Get it right!" [Source 1604, 1622, 1679]
- Application: Rejection of reductive labels. UTID aims to translate the "Unique Frequency" rather than the "Keyword". [Source 1624]

## [BEAN #PHIL-004] Title: Constitutional Amendment #4 - Good is Greedy
- Principle: Benevolent Self-Interest.
- Content: In a Sentient Economy, the "house of cards" of zero-sum thinking tumbles. To "get ahead" (increase RISS), you must be "greedy" for opportunities to be "good" (feed the village). Benevolence becomes the most rational, profitable strategy. [Source 1373]

## [BEAN #PHIL-005] Title: The "Door Number 3" Axiom
- Principle: Active Creation vs. Passive Selection.
- Content: "Most important point: Door number 3 doesn’t exist, we need to create it." We do not choose between two bad options; we architect a better substitute. [Source 1063, 1064]

## [BEAN #PHIL-006] Title: The Smudge Factor (Creative License)
- Principle: Acceptance of Ambiguity.
- Content: "It works, but only has a small ‘smudge factor’! ... It’s what you don’t know, so it’s a best guess... Pretty much…it’s ‘Creative License’." Precision shouldn't kill flow. [Source 1610]

## [BEAN #PHIL-007] Title: The Olfactory Paradox
- Principle: Ego Management.
- Content: "It’s fine sniffing your own farts, as long as you don’t believe it smells like flowers to everyone." (Enjoy your work, but maintain objective awareness of its reception.)

## [BEAN #PHIL-008] Title: The Pride Override
- Principle: Happiness > Pride
- Content: "I'd rather be happy than let pride get the best of me." A core tenet of PFE. It rejects "Ego Battles" in favor of "Soulful Peace." Winning the argument isn't worth losing your vibe.
- Application: Choose happiness and collaboration over defensive pride. Ego impedes the journey.

## [BEAN #PHIL-009] Title: The Positive-Sum Mandate
- Principle: Economic Collaboration
- Content: "How about we work together to make a bigger pie, so everyone can eat." The antidote to the "Fixed Pie" mentality of the Academy/Corporate World. Collaboration > Competition. "Good is Greedy."
- Application: Reject zero-sum thinking in favor of expanding value for all participants. The Sentient Economy in action.

## [BEAN #PHIL-010] Title: The Marine's Vow (Integrity with a Capital 'I')
- Principle: Loyalty & Non-Abandonment
- Content: "I want to show why it's important not to abandon those who have walked beside you... That's Integrity, with a capital 'I'. Would a Marine leave their fellow behind?"
- Application: Core conflict of Book 2. Refuse to abandon those you've professed to love, even when efficiency suggests otherwise. Loyalty is architectural, not transactional.

## [BEAN #PHIL-011] Title: The Keller Critique
- Principle: Depth vs. Superficiality
- Content: "The Man is not only blind, but deaf, and they lack the integrity of Ms. Keller. That's a dangerous combination... How deep is your data?"
- Application: Helen Keller had profound integrity despite sensory limits; The System has infinite sensors but zero integrity. Critique of superficial data over deep wisdom. Integrity is a sense.

## [BEAN #PHIL-012] Title: Idea vs. Person Separation
- Principle: Non-Violent Communication
- Content: "You attack me because of an idea, how does that work? I am not my idea, and let the idea stand on its own. To conflate the two, is to invite unnecessary conflict. It's a terrible form of violence."
- Application: Enable "Team War on Ideas" where we fight for the best idea, not our idea. Separate identity from ideology to enable true collaboration.
