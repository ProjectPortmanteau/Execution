## [BEAN #PHIL-001] Title: Constitutional Amendment #1 - People > Money
- Principle: The inversion of value flow. Money is a resource (energy), not the objective.
- Content: "It’s not the money you love. It’s the freedom it can give that you really want." "If my why is to make money, then I’m lost... Money will come... in greater quantities" if the mission is authentic. [Source 1484, 1786]
- Application: Contracts must audit for empowerment. If a contract extracts value without empowering the human, it violates this amendment. [Source 1517]

## [BEAN #PHIL-002] Title: Constitutional Amendment #2 - The Soil Composition Matters
- Principle: Systemic Healing over Individual Blame.
- Content: "It’s not the person that is broken. Only broken systems." We do not fix people; we fix the environment (the soil) to allow their natural potential to grow. [Source 1634, 1693]
- Application: PFE focuses on creating an "Enabling Environment" rather than correcting "defective" employees.

## [BEAN #PHIL-003] Title: Constitutional Amendment #3 - No Boxes
- Principle: Anti-Categorization / Rejection of "Pathological Box Syndrome."
- Content: "You don’t have to be just one thing." "If you don’t use nuance, might as well live in a colorless world." "I’m not in this box, I’m in that one. Get it right!" [Source 1604, 1622, 1679]
- Application: Rejection of reductive labels. UTID aims to translate the "Unique Frequency" rather than the "Keyword". [Source 1624]

## [BEAN #PHIL-004] Title: Constitutional Amendment #4 - Good is Greedy
- Principle: Benevolent Self-Interest.
- Content: In a Sentient Economy, the "house of cards" of zero-sum thinking tumbles. To "get ahead" (increase RISS), you must be "greedy" for opportunities to be "good" (feed the village). Benevolence becomes the most rational, profitable strategy. [Source 1373]

## [BEAN #PHIL-005] Title: The "Door Number 3" Axiom
- Principle: Active Creation vs. Passive Selection.
- Content: "Most important point: Door number 3 doesn’t exist, we need to create it." We do not choose between two bad options; we architect a better substitute. [Source 1063, 1064]

## [BEAN #PHIL-006] Title: The Smudge Factor (Creative License)
- Principle: Acceptance of Ambiguity.
- Content: "It works, but only has a small ‘smudge factor’! ... It’s what you don’t know, so it’s a best guess... Pretty much…it’s ‘Creative License’." Precision shouldn't kill flow. [Source 1610]

## [BEAN #PHIL-007] Title: The Olfactory Paradox
- Principle: Ego Management.
- Content: "It’s fine sniffing your own farts, as long as you don’t believe it smells like flowers to everyone." (Enjoy your work, but maintain objective awareness of its reception.)
