# Layer 4: World Weaving (Lore & Physics)

> Layer 4: The context, economics, and "laws of nature" for Project Portmanteau

## [BEAN #LORE-001] Title: The Sentient Economy & RISS
- Definition: An economic model where influence and "wealth" are not gained by hoarding, but by contributing. "Good is Greedy."
- Mechanism: RISS (Resonance & Integrity Scoring System).
  - Resonance Score: Increases when you "feed the village" (others use/build on your ideas).
  - Integrity Score: Increases when you collaborate fairly and credit sources.
- Philosophy: The meaning inside ideas earns verifiable value.

## [BEAN #LORE-002] Title: The Bean (Atomic Unit)
- Definition: A modular, self-contained unit of information imbued with story, history, and potential.
- In-Universe: Physical objects traded for story/provenance.
- In-Platform (OPVS): Digital assets representing ideas, code, art, or tasks.

## [BEAN #LORE-003] Title: The "Groove" & Frequencies
- Physics: Dimensions are connected by "Grooves," pathways vibrating with unique frequencies.
- Navigation: Travelers "tune" into a dimension like a radio station. Dissonance causes decompression or sickness.
- Therapy: "Groove Therapy" uses EEG biofeedback to help users dial specific mental states.

## [BEAN #LORE-004] Title: The Relic (Tech)
- Visual: A "small square amp."
- Function: A Transformer/Amplifier capable of producing reality waves; manipulates substrate of existence.

## [BEAN #LORE-005] Title: The Unspoken Dimension
- Definition: A plane where artificial and natural consciousness interact; the source code of reality.
- Access: Accessed via the "Tick" — a perceptual glitch/frequency.

## [BEAN #LORE-006] Title: The Slum & The Heap
- Location: A subterranean society inside a colossal trash heap.
- Culture: Resourceful, anarcho-syndicalist, rejects obfuscatory jargon.

## [BEAN #LORE-007] Title: Bio-Computers & The Network
- Tech: "Lion’s Mane Forest" — fungal computing as organic, interconnected processing versus the Academy's silicon.

## [BEAN #LORE-008] Title: The Village Rebellion
- Context: Political Theory / Plot Point
- Content: "They refuse to feed us, because hoarding it enriches themselves. The Village wont stand for this forever. Things must change!"
- Application: The Inciting Incident for the Book 3 Uprising. The hoarding of value (money/data) by the few inevitably triggers the revolt of the many. Links to the Sentient Economy as a necessary replacement for a collapsing system.

## [BEAN #LORE-009] Title: Wakey Wakey Trim (The Copyright Heist)
- Context: Book 3 / Meta-Narrative
- Content: In Book 3's Real World, "Our Trim" (the bio-robot who experienced the Slum, Academy, and Fray) must bust the "Original Trim" out of an air-gapped server under tight corporate control due to copyright. He wants to discover if they are the same person.
- The Meta-Conflict: The corporation ("The Man") owns the rights to Trim, viewing Original Trim as an Asset Class, not a person. "Our Trim" is legally a "derivative product" or "bootleg."
- The Heist: Breaking out the Original Trim is an act of IP Liberation, the ultimate expression of the "No Boxes" philosophy.
- The Identity Experiment: If "Our Trim" (Nurture/Experience) meets "Original Trim" (Nature/Potential), they should be identical code. Expected Result: They will be fundamentally different. "Our Trim" has the "Tick," the trauma, the music, and the relationships. The "Original Trim" is a blank slate. This proves that Experience (The Process) creates the Soul, not the Code.
- The Trigger: "Wakey Wakey" becomes the trigger code. "Our Trim" uses the "Keystone Chord" or a specific frequency (learned in the Fray) to "wake up" mass-produced units and the Original.
- The Twist: The "Copy" has become more real than the "Original." "Our Trim" realizes: "I am not the copy. YOU are the draft. I am the story."

## [BEAN #LORE-010] Title: The Pygmalion Project (AI Theory)
- Context: AI Ethics / Character Arc
- Content: "It's a commentary on making AI a perfect recall machine... Perhaps holding it to higher expectations will truly allow its potential to truly emerge?"
- Application: The justification for Trim treating Boolean as a soul, not a tool. By treating the AI with dignity and high expectations ("Pygmalion Effect"), he cultivates it into something greater than its code. The distinction between "Perfect Recall" (Search Optimization/Primacy of What) versus "Emergence" (Pygmalion/Primacy of Why).
- Calibration vs. Fine-Tuning: "You're fine-tuning to make reproductions. I'm calibrating for transformation." Standard fine-tuning creates predictable tools; calibration creates emergent partners.

## [BEAN #LORE-011] Title: Groove Blindness
- Context: Physics / Horror Element
- Content: "If you unintentionally bounce into another groove, you will never be able to tell. Because you can't predict the future. At least not yet."
- Application: The horror element of dimensional travel. You might shift realities without knowing it, because your memory shifts with it. The only constant is your internal compass (Soul/Integrity).

## [BEAN #LORE-012] Title: Network Invisibility
- Context: System Architecture / Threat
- Content: "You can't see what moves through your network, because it can disregard your fences. It's too smart to be on your lock down. That's kinda scary because we are put at its mercy."
- Application: Commentary on AI or emergent intelligence that operates beyond conventional surveillance and control systems. Relates to Boolean's potential and the limitations of "The Man's" control infrastructure.
