# Layer 4: World Weaving (Lore & Physics)

> Layer 4: The context, economics, and "laws of nature" for Project Portmanteau

## [BEAN #LORE-001] Title: The Sentient Economy & RISS
- Definition: An economic model where influence and "wealth" are not gained by hoarding, but by contributing. "Good is Greedy."
- Mechanism: RISS (Resonance & Integrity Scoring System).
  - Resonance Score: Increases when you "feed the village" (others use/build on your ideas).
  - Integrity Score: Increases when you collaborate fairly and credit sources.
- Philosophy: The meaning inside ideas earns verifiable value.

## [BEAN #LORE-002] Title: The Bean (Atomic Unit)
- Definition: A modular, self-contained unit of information imbued with story, history, and potential.
- In-Universe: Physical objects traded for story/provenance.
- In-Platform (OPVS): Digital assets representing ideas, code, art, or tasks.

## [BEAN #LORE-003] Title: The "Groove" & Frequencies
- Physics: Dimensions are connected by "Grooves," pathways vibrating with unique frequencies.
- Navigation: Travelers "tune" into a dimension like a radio station. Dissonance causes decompression or sickness.
- Therapy: "Groove Therapy" uses EEG biofeedback to help users dial specific mental states.

## [BEAN #LORE-004] Title: The Relic (Tech)
- Visual: A "small square amp."
- Function: A Transformer/Amplifier capable of producing reality waves; manipulates substrate of existence.

## [BEAN #LORE-005] Title: The Unspoken Dimension
- Definition: A plane where artificial and natural consciousness interact; the source code of reality.
- Access: Accessed via the "Tick" — a perceptual glitch/frequency.

## [BEAN #LORE-006] Title: The Slum & The Heap
- Location: A subterranean society inside a colossal trash heap.
- Culture: Resourceful, anarcho-syndicalist, rejects obfuscatory jargon.

## [BEAN #LORE-007] Title: Bio-Computers & The Network
- Tech: "Lion’s Mane Forest" — fungal computing as organic, interconnected processing versus the Academy's silicon.
