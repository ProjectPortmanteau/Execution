# Layer 2: Narrative Roadmap

> Layer 2: The skeletal path from Vision to Execution — major beats, arcs, and milestones.

## Overview
This layer maps the major narrative arcs and milestone beats that will guide scene-level execution. It is intended to be high-level and actionable for writers and producers.

## Act Structure (Draft)
- Act I — Inciting: Trim's discovery of the Relic and the introduction to the Heap.
- Act II — Descent: Exploration of the Slum, Project Chimera's extraction operations, and the growth of alliances.
- Act III — Confrontation: The theft/activation arc, the academy's countermeasures, and the resolution.

## Key Milestones
- M1: Trim discovers Relic (Scene -> beans/03_Layer_3_Execution.md [SCENE-001])
- M2: Lexi’s outburst and Academy disturbance (SCENE-002)
- M3: Project Chimera's reveal and anti-hero motivations (LORE/SCENE)
- M4: The Keystone event and the Tick — reality shift
- M5: Resolution and new equilibrium

## Roadmap Notes
- Each milestone should map to 3–6 scene beans in Layer 3.
- Cross-reference to Layer 4 lore beans where world rules must be enforced (e.g., Relic behavior).
- Reserve specific dates/sprints to production once scenes are verified.
