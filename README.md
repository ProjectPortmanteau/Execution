## Navigating This Blueprint

This repository acts as the "Operating System" for the novel's creation, structured into six distinct **Layers**, each containing modular atomic units called **"Beans"**.

*   **[Layer 0: Philosophy (The Soul Code)](beans/00_Philosophy.md)**
    *   The ethical axioms and "Constitutional Amendments" that govern the ecosystem (e.g., "People > Money," "Good is Greedy"). This is the physics of our world.
*   **[Layer 1: Visionary Blueprint](beans/01_Layer_1_Visionary_Blueprint.md)**
    *   The macro-structure, three-act architecture, and thematic soul of *Portmanteau: Awakened*.
*   **[Layer 2: Narrative Roadmap](beans/02_Layer_2_Narrative_Roadmap.md)**
    *   The linear spine of the story. Chapter-by-chapter outlines and "Call to Adventure" sequences.
*   **[Layer 3: Execution & Scene Construction](beans/03_Layer_3_Execution.md)**
    *   Where the rubber meets the road. Actual prose, dialogue, and scene beats.
*   **[Layer 4: World Weaving (Lore & Physics)](beans/04_Layer_4_Lore.md)**
    *   The context manual. Definitions of the Sentient Economy, RISS, Grooves, and the Relic.
*   **[Layer 5: Process Chronicle](beans/05_Layer_5_Process.md)**
    *   "Behind the Curtain." Methodology, "Bizarre Logic," and the "Smudge Factor" that keeps the creative engine running.
